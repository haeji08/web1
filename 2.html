<h2>Dance</h2>
<p>Dance is a performing art form consisting of sequences of movement, either improvised
or purposefully selected. This movement has aesthetic and often symbolic value.
Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements,
or by its historical period or place of origin. An important distinction is to be drawn
between the contexts of theatrical and participatory dance, although these two categories
are not always completely separate; both may have special functions, whether social, ceremonial,
competitive, erotic, martial, or sacred/liturgical. Other forms of human movement are sometimes said
to have a dance-like quality, including martial arts, gymnastics, cheerleading, figure skating,
synchronised swimming, marching bands, and many other forms of athletics.
