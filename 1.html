<h2>Music</h2>
<p><strong><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music" target = "_blank" title="Music specification">Music</a> is the
<u>art</u> </strong>of arranging sounds in time to
produce a composition through the elements of melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre.
It is one of the cultural universal aspects of all human societies. General definitions
of music include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm
(and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness),
and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound).</p>

<p style="margin-top:45px;">Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from
singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental
accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek μουσική
(mousike; "(art) of the Muses") see § Etymology and glossary of musical terminology.</p>
