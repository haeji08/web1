<h2>Literature</h2>
<p>
  Literature broadly is any collection of written work, but it is also used more
  narrowly for writings specifically considered to be an art form, especially prose
  fiction, drama, and poetry.[2] In recent centuries, the definition has expanded to
  include oral literature, much of which has been transcribed. Literature is a
  method of recording, preserving, and transmitting knowledge and entertainment.
  Literature, as an art form, can also include works in various non-fiction genres,
  such as autobiography, diaries, memoir, letters, and the essay. Within its broad definition,
  literature includes non-fictional books, articles or other printed information on a
  particular subject.
