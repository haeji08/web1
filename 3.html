<h2>Drawing</h2>
<p>
  Drawing is a form of visual art in which an artist uses instruments to mark paper
  or other two-dimensional surface. Drawing instruments include graphite pencils, pen
  and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes, colored pencils, crayons, charcoal,
  chalk, pastels, erasers, markers, styluses, and metals (such as silverpoint). Digital
  drawing is the act of using a computer to draw. Common methods of digital drawing
  include a stylus or finger on a touchscreen device, stylus- or finger-to-touchpad,
  or in some cases, a mouse. There are many digital art programs and devices.A drawing
  instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark.
  The most common support for drawing is paper, although other materials, such as
  cardboard, wood, plastic, leather, canvas, and board, have been used. Temporary
  drawings may be made on a blackboard or whiteboard. Drawing has been a popular and
  fundamental means of public expression throughout human history. It is one of the simplest
  and most efficient means of communicating ideas. The wide availability of drawing
  instruments makes drawing one of the most common artistic activities.In addition to its
  more artistic forms, drawing is frequently used in commercial illustration, animation,
  architecture, engineering, and technical drawing. A quick, freehand drawing, usually not
  intended as a finished work, is sometimes called a sketch. An artist who practices or works
  in technical drawing may be called a drafter, draftsman, or draughtsman.
