<h2>The Arts</h2>
<p>
  The arts refers to the theory, human application and physical expression of creativity
  found in human cultures and societies through skills and imagination in order to produce
  objects, environments and experiences. Major constituents of the arts include visual
  arts (including architecture, ceramics, drawing, filmmaking, painting, photography,
  and sculpting), literary arts (including fiction, drama, poetry, and prose), performing
  arts (including dance, music, and theatre), and culinary arts (including cooking, chocolate
  making and winemaking). Some art forms combine a visual element with performance
  (e.g. cinematography), or artwork with the written word (e.g. comics). From prehistoric cave
  paintings to modern-day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying humankind's
  relationship with the environment.
